        <p>Body Building</p>
        <p>
            Training and living a fitness-based lifestyle is a serious commitment. So, when you take that time to
            exercise, you want
            to know that the approach you’re using is one that will work, especially with cardio.

            There are several approaches to consider, and one has received a lot of attention due of its effectiveness
            as well as
            the simplicity of applying it to your workout regimen. I’m talking about Zone 2 training.

            If this is new to you, then consider this your introductory course. We’ll cover what Zone 2 is, how it can
            help you,
            back it up with science, and then help you implement it into your personal plan so you can make the most out
            of your
            cardio.

            <p> If you were to look at your body as a building, the aerobic capacity could be considered a big part of
                the foundation.
                Training in Zone 2 can help you lay that foundation in a slow and calculated way. Taking the time to
                work on improving
                your fitness and training in Zone 2 with a lower heart rate can provide more bricks to that foundation.

                In other words, your capacity to work harder and get more results can be improved. So, if you’re in a
                situation that
                calls for you to work or train harder, such as a race or HIIT class, then you’ll be better prepared for
                that level of
                work, and you can get more results from it.</p>

        <span class="offer-span">
            <p> Some fitness-minded people like numbers and hard evidence, so we got you covered for that as well. The
                first thing
                you’re going to do is buy a heart rate monitor because you’ll need it. You can get one online or at most
                sporting goods
                stores.

                Next, you’re going to determine your absolute max heart rate. Get a calculator for this part. The
                standard for this is
                to take the number 220 and subtract your age. So, for a 30-year-old person, that would be 190 beats per
                minute (BPM).
                220-30=190

                Next, you will take that max heart rate number and calculate 60 percent and 70 percent. Using our
                30-year-old as the
                example again, that would be 60-70 percent of 190, which is a range of 114 to 133.

                Once you have those numbers, hook up your monitor and start doing cardio. Remember that you shouldn’t
                have to put that
                much effort into it. It can be any of the activities mentioned above, or you could use this guideline
                while doing other
                activities such as yard work. If you fall under that 60 percent number, pick up the pace. If you break
                70 percent, slow
                down.
